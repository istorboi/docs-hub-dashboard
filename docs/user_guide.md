</p>

</div>
<br/><br/>

## Overview and Views
<div align="justify">

These functionalities allow to define and show the most suitable visualizations to monitor the port activity depending on the specific needs of each port.

Note: Most of the visualizations that a user can create are related with model executions. Before creating these visualizations, the user has to add a model an run it form the operational tools functionality.

**Views**<br/>
From the *list of views* , the user can manage the mots appropriate visualizations to control the port activity. The list of views provides a search mechanism (1) to filter by name, source or type the views showed in the table. The Add (2) button allows to create a new visualization. For each visualization (4), the user can change the visualization status.   Only the enabled visualization will appear in the overview.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/ListViews.png" alt="Views' List" align="center" />
</p>

The add visualization functionality has three steps.
  -	1st Step: the user chooses the model for which he wants to create a new visualization. Currently the  platform provides visualization for the PAS model and for the Predictive ETD algorithm. Moreover, the user can create a custom visualization.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/FirstStep.png" alt="First step" align="center" />
</p>

  -	2nd Step: In the second step, the user chooses the visualization most appropriated for the analysis he wants to perform.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/SecondStep.png" alt="Second step" align="center" />
</p>

  -	3rd Step: In the third step, the user define the name of the visualization and select the proper model execution to be shown.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/ThirdStep.png" alt="Third step" align="center" />
</p>

**Process of creating and visualizing a new view**<br/>
To show a new visualization on the overview you need to follow these steps:
  - In the list view, click the add button (1)
  - Complete the three steps for creating a new  visualization (2)
  -	Look for the visualization created (3)
  -	Change the status from disabled to enabled (4)
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/CreateNewView.png" alt="Create new view" align="center" />
</p>

If a user wants to create a custom visualization, independent from any model, in the process of creating a new visualization, the user has to select the custom option in the step 1. In the next figure, you  can see how a user can create a custom visualization to show in an iframe the content of other web.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/CustomView.png" alt="Custom view" align="center" />
</p>

**Overviews**<br/>
The overview is the main control panel to monitor and analyse the port activities.  The overview will show all the enabled views in a table of two cols. Next figure depicts the layout of the visualizations showed in the overview.

<p align="center">

**Publish - Export to Information Hub**<br/>
After defining rules, resources, and supply chains, you should publish this information to be available for the PAS Model. To publish the information created you only need to press the “Export to IH” button available in in list of rules, resources, and supply chains.  After executing the action, you will see  the execution result with the name of the index created.  You will need to specify the name of the index when you run a new instance of the model.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/exportToIH.png" alt="Export to IH" align="center" />
</p>

Every time that a user updates any information related with the Port Activity scenario it is needed to use export the information (Export to IH) to have the new data available for the PAS model.

<br/><br/>

## Operational Tools
<div align="justify">
PIXEL is a flexible analytical platform; through the operational tools (OP Tools) you can install new analytical functionalities and perform as many analyses as you need. 
In PIXEL the analytical functions have been grouped in 2 types. The functionalities based on models(1) and the functionalities based on predictive algorithms (2). Both can be executed on demand (3) or can be programmed to be executed periodically (4) . After the executions (5), graphs (6) or KPIs (7) can be created to show the results of the model/algorithm executions

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/otools_diagram.png" alt="OTools' Diagram" align="center" />
</p>

**Models**<br/>
The models functionality is part of the OP Tools and  allows you to manage the models added/installed in the platform . The Add model button allow us to create/ add a new model into the PIXEL platform, the information needed is the label or name of the model and the docker name.  All the models are encapsulated into docker components.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/modelsManagement.png" alt="Models Management" align="center" />
</p>

*Schedule*<br/>
The schedule functionality allows you to manage the scheduled executions of a model. To Add  a new schedule (1) you have to provide the name of the schedule, the parameters of the model and the schedule information. Each model has different Parameters  (2), in the example we have chosen the “vessels-SEI” property.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/scheduleModel.png" alt="Schedule a Model" align="center" />
</p>

After the model is executed, it is possible to verify the execution results from the view button (1). At any moment, the user can pause / run (play)  (2) the scheduled executions of a model.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/executionResult.png" alt="Result of the execution" align="center" />
</p>

*Run Model*<br/>
The Run functionality allows you to manage the on demand executions of a model. To Add  a new Run(1) you have to provide the name of the run and the parameters of the model. Each model has different Parameters. As soon as you confirm the run, the model is executed. The status property of the table will show the “Finished” value when the execution ends. From the view (2) button, it is possible to view the result of the execution.

<p align="center">

</p>

**Predictive Algorithms**<br/>
The Predictive Algorithms functionality is part of the OP Tools and  allows you to manage the algorithms added/installed in the platform. The functionality is equivalent to the model functionality, but in this case instead of running Artificial Intelligent Models, it runs predictive algorithms.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pixel-ports/docs-hub-dashboard/raw/master/docs/img/user_guide/predictiveManagement.png" alt="Predictive Algorithms" align="center" />
</p>

**KPIs**<br/>
The KPI functionality allows you to create different KPI related with model execution. There are two types of KPIs, environmental KPIs and Operational KPI. You can define as many KPIs (1) as you need and show the trends of them (2).
